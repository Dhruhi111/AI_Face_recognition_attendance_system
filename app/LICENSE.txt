
## Additional Recommendations

1. Dataset: Since you have many training images, consider:
   - Creating a separate `dataset/` folder with subfolders for each person
   - Or uploading the dataset to a cloud storage (like Google Drive) and linking to it

2. Demo: Add a screenshot of your web interface to the `static/` folder and reference it in the README

3. License: Add a LICENSE file (MIT is common for open source projects)

4. Training Script: Consider adding your training script if you want others to retrain the model

5. Video Demo: You could record a short demo and upload it to YouTube, then link it in your README

6. Deployment: Add instructions for deploying to platforms like Heroku if relevant

This comprehensive structure and documentation will make your project much more professional and accessible to others who might want to use or contribute to it.
